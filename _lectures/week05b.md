# Announcements

Regarding week 8 (Thanksgiving week):
* We will have class 2pm-3:15 on Tuesday Nov 21st.  If you will not be on campus, please at least plan to be somewhere you can zoom in.
* However, sections will not meet on Wednesday Nov 22nd.  Enjoy your Thanksgiving break.

team03 is due at midnight a week from tomorrow, i.e. Thursday 11/09.  Aim for then.
* The grace period is through that weekend (which is a three-day weekend; there are no classes on Friday 11/10), i.e. the final day/time to submit on Canvas is 11:59 Monday 11/13.
* That allows us to start the legacy code projects on Tuesday 11/14.

# Today
* Standup on team02 if not done
* When done with team02, start team03
