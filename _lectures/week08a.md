Today's class will be devoted entirely to Retro3.

Please see your gdrive folder, look for the retro3 document, and follow the instructions.

As a reminder:
* Sections are cancelled on Wednesday 11.22 since it is after 5pm on the day before break.
  - In theory, the registrar's official position is that those classes are supposed to meet.
  - In practice, it would be wildly unrealistic to expect you to show up that day, or even to participate online.
* Thursday 11.23 and Friday 11.24 are University Holidays.   Enjoy your break, but perhaps do try to get a little work done over the break if you can.
