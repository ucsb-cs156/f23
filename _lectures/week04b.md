# team01

Remember that it's a *team* project and a *team* grade.

When you've done your part, chip in to help the rest of the team get finished.

# Start with a Standup

* Do a standup meeting to update the team on progress with team01.
  * Please post written update in slack channel first
  * Then when all have posted, do out loud standing standup

# Review team01 Kanban Board

Then, As a team, review your Kanban board, and estimate when the team will be finished with team01.  Post that in your slack channel.

# Then, its work time on team01.

If your team reaches the point of being able to submit team01 today before class ends:

* Please post on #help-lecture-discussion and one of us will come around to take a look.
* If all looks ok, you are then free to leave early; we don't have team02 ready to go just yet.
