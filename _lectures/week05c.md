# For lecture today:

* Start with standup

Then: even if not finished with team02, please do the following
* Find your repo and Kanban board for team03
* Find the first issue for your database table (the tables are the same as for team02).  This could be either the creation of your dokku dev deployment, or it could be migrating your @entity, @repository, controller and controller tests from team02 to team03.
* Drag that issue into In Progress and assign it to yourself on the Kanban board.

I would prefer not to make this a "participation assignment"; I'd prefer to invite the teams to hold one another accountable for this.  So, please check that all six members of your team have done this.  It may be helpful to make a post in the team slack channel saying "All six team members have an in progress issue".

I'd like to suggest that for future standups, that this be a part of the process, i.e.
* As part of your sharing on the slack channel, make a note of whether you have something in the in progress column for the project the team is working on,
* If you don't personally have something in the "in progress" column, fix that before standup. 
* During the out loud part of the standup, someone bring up the kanban board and verify that each person has an "in progress" issue.

The only time it would be normal to NOT have something there is if/when all of the issues for the team are "In Review" or "Done".
Even if all the issues for your database table are finished, if there are other issues to be done, you can assign yourself as a pair partner and help your teammates finish.
